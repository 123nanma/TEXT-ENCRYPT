Here are some key highlights of the project:

🔐 AES Encryption: Provides a robust encryption mechanism using a password-based key.
💻 PyQt5 Interface: A clean and user-friendly interface that facilitates encryption and decryption tasks.
📝 Text Encryption: Encrypt plain text and view the encrypted result as a Base64-encoded string.
🔑 Secure Key Generation: Uses a password to generate an AES key, ensuring secure encryption and decryption.

📂 Functionality:

Encrypt Text: Enter text, input a password, and generate an encrypted result.
Decrypt Text: Input the encrypted text, provide the password, and restore the original message
